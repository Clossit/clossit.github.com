HereÎéÎ÷s a useful script for all you Google Analytics addicts. The first thing I find myself doing whenever I go to the Google Analytics dashboard is clicking the calendar and setting the date range to include the current day. Very annoying to do. I whipped up a quick script to automatically change the date, all the ones out there seem to have broken since the new dashboard update.

  Note: Chrome has a wonderful new annoyance feature that does not allow installing extensions or scripts from anywhere aside from their Extension Gallery. YouÎéÎ÷ll have to Save As the script and drag it to your chrome://chrome/extensions settings tab.
